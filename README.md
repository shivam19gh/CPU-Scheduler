# CPU-Scheduler

This project simulates and analyzes different CPU scheduling algorithms to understand their performance characteristics. CPU scheduling is crucial for optimizing the utilization of CPU resources in operating systems.

Language used in the project : C++

CPU scheduling involves selecting processes from the ready queue and allocating them to the CPU. Key algorithms include:

FCFS (First-Come, First-Served): Processes are executed in the order they arrive.
SJF (Shortest Job First): Processes with the shortest burst time are executed first.
Round Robin: Each process is executed for a small unit of time (time quantum).
Priority Scheduling: Processes with the highest priority are executed first.

The project simulates these algorithms and evaluates metrics such as average waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.
